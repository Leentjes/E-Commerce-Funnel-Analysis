## Conclusions 📈

- **Insight 1:** Canada’s higher CVR (1.75%) indicates a smoother customer journey, despite lower interaction levels than the U.S.
- **Insight 2:** The largest drop-off occurs at the "Add Payment Info" step for all countries, revealing a major barrier in the checkout process.
- **Insight 3:** Early-stage abandonment is common, particularly after viewing items or adding them to the cart, suggesting concerns about motivation or perceived value.

## Recommendations 💡

- **Investigate Barriers:**
    - Analyze the "Add Payment Info" step for usability issues, loading times, and device compatibility.

- **Device-Specific Analysis:**
    - Conduct analysis by device type (desktop, mobile, tablet) to identify and address any specific drop-off pain points.

- **Further Segmentation:**
    - Segment data by operating system and browser to pinpoint technical issues affecting drop-off rates.

## Possible Follow-Up Questions
1. **View Item:** Are they our target customers?
2. **Add to Cart:** What deters them from buying? (Product info, quality photos, site navigation, pricing)
3. **Begin Checkout:** Why the lack of urgency to purchase?
4. **Add Payment Info:** What discourages customers? (Readability on smaller devices, functionality on different OS, loading time)
5. **Purchase:** What differentiates successful conversions? (Marketing campaigns, medium, traffic source, timeframe)

## Context & Goal 🎯
- **Objective:** Analyze the customer journey in the top three markets (U.S., India, and Canada) and identify opportunities to enhance conversion rates.
- **Description:** This funnel analysis models six key interaction points: page view, view item, add to cart, begin checkout, add payment info, and purchase. It helps track where customers are most likely to drop off.
- **Goal:** Pinpoint areas for improving website functionality and customer engagement, leading to an enhanced user experience and higher conversion rates. The analysis is based on data from the raw-events table, capturing interactions at each stage.
